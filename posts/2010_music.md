for a concert that took place in the Kevin Barry Room at the National Concert Hall, Dublin hosted by the Irish Composer's Collective<br>

A simple geometric process transforms harmonic material, from section to section, in the acoustic space. It was writ without an idea of semantic structure. In other words, with a lot of curiosity and not that much technical know-how. Many of the works from around this time were playing around with these sort of "elastic" structures. I would take simple melodies and stretch them out by translating them to-and-from functions that would plot out the structural transformations that took place as the metres changed. Below are a couple of sketches from a notebook.
