<h3>3. Nov 13</h3>
Some rain
still mild
although
ground below freezing
gentle breeze
enough light.
That is if a bird can peer.
A blue mountain before spring.

<h3>5. Nov 13</h3>
Again more rain
temperature rises
ground thaws
moderate breeze and even less light.
This time of course no idea.

<h3>6. Nov 13</h3>
Not so much rain
ground cool
wind dropping
although very little light.
To begin with
birds whistling in an empty park
(or something charming like that).

<h3>7. Nov 13</h3>
Some rain
getting warmer again
although ground cooling
wind rising and even some light.
There peering through the downpour,
through the fog, content,
that bird again.

<h3>10. Nov 13</h3>
No whistling.
The damp cools.

<h3>12. Nov 13</h3>
Ninety seven, even closer to the ground
and this time with intent.
Just a few drops of rain
but finally some decent light.

<h3>14. Nov 13</h3>
Still quite warm
wind dropping
overcast.
That bird again, if a bird can peer,
remains seated on the wall there.

<h3>16. Nov 13</h3>
Senile and determined.
wind apparently dead.

<h3>17. Nov 13</h3>
Very still.
No whistling, not a peep out through the bruise.

<h3>18. Nov 13</h3>
That is if a bird can peer of course.
Wind increasing.

<h3>20. Nov 13</h3>
Fixed to the ground just long enough
to feign some rest.
Wind picks up again.

<h3>21. Nov 13</h3>
This time understandably no idea
after or before the forgetfulness
(or something charming like that)
of no earthly use
probably discarded.
a light baffling wind,
more rain and less light.

<h3>22. Nov 13</h3>
Ground frozen.
Mottled.

<h3>23. Nov 13</h3>
Rain and less light.
Ninety seven,
even closer to ground and this time with intent
peering through the bruise
understandably no idea
creeping, whistling.

<h3>24. Nov 13</h3>
More rain
and even less light remains.

<h3>25. Nov 13</h3>
That is if a bird can peer
through the bruise,

<h3>26. Nov 13</h3>
through the fog,
content.
in the meantime
quiet
a blue mountain before spring
another bruise.

<h3>27. Nov 13</h3>
The rain
does not move
it simply hangs
takes its place

<h3>28. Nov 13</h3>
between a last
somewhere
and
some sort of light.

<h3>2. Dec 13</h3>
The last heap
that bird again,
that elaborate objection,
remains sitting somewhere.
Old leaky and quiet
a leftover eye.
No rain.

<h3>3. Dec 13</h3>
The pile
still with calm.
Scattered light
wind picks up.

<h3>4. Dec 13</h3>
More rain.
In addition to the pile
that heap, the attempt

<h3>5. Dec 13</h3>
the tower.
Air again.

<h3>6. Dec 13</h3>
Itself
the last heap,
quivers
somewhere
before an end
damp
and cool.

<h3>8. Dec 13</h3>
Mostly ornament.
Rain.

<h3>9. Dec 13</h3>
A gale
Old and ice berg like.

<h3>11. Dec 13</h3>
ever quiet
unintentionally.
Heavy rain
warm air.

<h3>12. Dec 13</h3>
Still no light.
A recumbent gale.

<h3>13. Dec 13</h3>
Rain
reminded of
that old sausage.

<h3>15. Dec 13</h3>
More rain
again
almost no light
and yes
of course
the remains of silence.

<h3>16. Dec 13</h3>
Overcast
inconspicuous.

<h3>17. Dec 13</h3>
Not even once
an appearance.
Light
more heavy rain,
wind picks up again


<h3>18. Dec 13</h3>
No light
stutters on

<h3>19. Dec 13</h3>
the eyes and ears
close
wind subsides
almost.
Still no light.

<h3>21. Dec 13</h3>
Heavy rain
again a gale
a constant murmur

<h3>23. Dec 13</h3>
again rain
ground frozen
a hoax.

<h3>24. Dec 13</h3>
So
the Wind picks up again.

<h3>25. Dec 13</h3>
Rain and hardly any light
between one or the other.

<h3>26. Dec 13</h3>
Without shelter
real silence.

<h3>3. Jan 14</h3>
the air alone.
A Storm with heavy rain
and then some sort of light.

<h3>4. Jan 14</h3>
A real downpour
old and ice berg like

<h3>5. Jan 14</h3>
a murmur
More rain
wind dropping
some light
and air remaining cool.

<h3>6. Jan 14</h3>
A continuous murmur.
Whole gale
heavy rain
air warmer
but hardly any light.

<h3>8. Jan 14</h3>
Less rain
light
but still a gale
all along only ornament.

<h3>9. Jan 14</h3>
Not seen
one day after the other
light.

<h3>10. Jan 14</h3>
Somewhere
ground
frozen.

<h3>12. Jan 14</h3>
No wind
ground still frozen.
More counterfeit rest
the last attempt
interrupted.

<h3>13. Jan 14</h3>
That's it then, no more.
Wind begins to blow a gale,
no light
and rain in torrents.

<h3>14. Jan 14</h3>
mostly there is
nothing to see
very little light

<h3>15. Jan 14</h3>
Legs and all
the last creature.
Very slowly
wind increases
and again
more rain.

<h3>16. Jan 14</h3>
A gale snorts
air warmer.

<h3>18. Jan 14</h3>
A backwards amount,
either plenty

<h3>19. Jan 14</h3>
ground frozen
or no light.

<h3>20. Jan 14</h3>
Most of the time nothing to see,
no real wind.

<h3>21. Jan 14</h3>
But sometimes
after
closing the eyes and ears
ample light and very little rain.

<h3>22. Jan 14</h3>
A gale
flickers,

<h3>23. Jan 14</h3>
stoops alongside
no light

<h3>30. Jan 14</h3>
Ground frozen,
light.
then
the creature,
poking along

<h3>31. Jan 14</h3>
before some sort of Rain,

<h3>1. Feb</h3>
remains
somewhere.
Wind

<h3>2. Feb 14</h3>
air alone,
ornament.

<h3>3. Feb 14</h3>
A whole gale
old
and ice berg like

<h3>4. Feb 14</h3>
heavy rain
and light
in turns

<h3>5. Feb 14</h3>
Then
air

<h3>6. Feb 14</h3>
about
the eyes and ears

<h2>The three granddaughters of the sea</h2>

partners: ["Ensemble Zeitfluss"]
instruments: ["Flute", "Bass Clarinet in b", "Saxophone", "Bassoon", "Percussion", "Piano", "Violin", "Viola", "Cello", "Contrabass"]

The rhythmical structure for this composition was created using weather data collected by the Met Éireann weather station that is positioned at Belmullet,
County Mayo in Ireland. At the time, I was very interested in observing naturally occuring processes and letting them structure the composition. Similar to the types of aleatoric processes used by composers like John Cage in the 20th century.
At the end of the day, the process is not really essential to what one hears in the piece - that usually ends up being sound in any event - getting some of the structural work out of the way with this sort of a procedure sort of clears the way for making decisions related to the orchestration.

## For the hills

partners: ["Schallfeld Ensemble", "Anna Sabelfeld", "Elisa Azarra", "Margarethe Maierhofer-Lischka"]
categories: ["Chamber Music", "Duo", "Trio"]

Both of these pieces were written for ensemble Schallfeld, who played them during a concert at St. Andrä Kirche in Graz.
The priest who gave us a loan of the hall - Hermann Glettler - since went on to become the bishop of Innsbruck.
He did some pretty interesting work in St. Andrä while he was in Graz, it's an interesting church if you ever get to have a look,
I can remember seeing a life sized crucifix covered in tiny mirrors. The congregation - who are mostly immigrants from Africa - ensure that it remains pretty
much the most lively church in Europe.

<h3>For the hills</h3>
A trio for Flute, Violin and Kontrabass.

It focuses three disparate lines that weave together in a loosely organized rhythmical space.

<h3>The dull morning of the big toe</h3>
A duo for Violin and Kontrabass

The title is a reference to the "Dark Night of the Soul", a mystical experience recorded by St. John of the Cross.
Apparently, the basic idea of the experience is that God, as well as the soul's path to God are essentially unknowable.

My title is more focused on worldly things, like a grey morning and a throbbing pain in your toe.
Whether or not these or similar experiences have anything to do with the former, I don't know.
