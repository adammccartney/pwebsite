[This](https://wincent.com/#fn-UG9zdDp0cmliYWwta25vd2xlZGdl-1) post by Greg
Hurrel sparked my interest lately. In it, he's making an interesting point
about "tribal knowledge" and does so without once reaching for the dreaded "c"
word. The post muses on the ambient presence of ideas and knowledge within a
group of people collected together into a software company. Specifically he's
talking about good habits that happen to be the norm at bigger companies and
noticing their absence elsewhere in other "more normal" work environments. 

+ numbers of developers working in these environments 

+ promise of the DevOps handbook
