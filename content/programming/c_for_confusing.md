# Implementing a simple shell 

## background
+ learning CS over a couple of years 
+ using teachyourselfcs.com 
+ operating systems three easy pieces (ostep book)
+ focus on one thing at a time 
+ be happy with any sort of progress

## juggling act
+ At work I'm programming web applications - specifically working with a small
  team to design a distributed system for publishing university research. The
  stack that I'm currently most involved with has python (django) on the
  backend with postgres and some javascript on the frontend. I'll talk a bit
  about that elsewhere. My development environment, as well as the production
  environment, are both linux. It is through the linux API that I'm probably
  getting the most exposure to c.
