Part of my work as a composer over the past ten years or so has been centered
around the process of creating notated scores and parts for musicians to play.
Currently I'm working on a short piece for orchestra that will be performed in
Dublin, Ireland by the National Symphony Orchestra later this year. I'm going
to document at least some of the work as I go. I've definitely always been
interested in a certain amount of DIY ethos in terms of how to approach music.
My dad is an electronic engineer, so the idea of inventing solutions to
problems was emparted early. Limerick, the town where I grew up, had a tiny 
punk scene and a healthy community of skaters who were all about doing things
yourself (organizing gigs or building things to skate). When I went to college
in Cork, I was lucky to hit it at a good time, when there were a couple of
really interesting grad students building their own electronic music systems
and thinking generally about interesting ways to use technology to approach the
creative act of making music. After Cork, I spent a couple of years as a grad
student in Graz, Austria. I would say the college there very much had a fairly
typical conservetoire approach to music, laying plenty of emphasis on the
importance of tradition and history. At the same time, the professor that I
studied with had the same sort of punk ethos that I was used to - if you wanted
to learn about writing music and living as a composer, the best thing to do was
simply to write the scores, organize the concerts and see what happens. Around
the same time in Graz, I got to know some of the people behind mur.at - an
organization focused on the free software movement and networked art. 

Around 2016, I decided to take a look at gnu lilypond as a tool for typesetting
scores. I've blogged a bit about elsewhere on the site. Since then I've tried
out a number of different approaches that encorporate lilypond as a way to
typeset music. 

## The destination and the journey
+ thought it would be possible to start modelling really cool algorithmic stuff
  musically - took alot longer than expected to master the basics
+ the journey had a lot more to do with discovering what type of architecture
  and approaches suited my particular style of thinking and way of working 
+ so where am I going now ... I honestly don't know

### straight lilypond, using frescobaldi IDE, acessible scripts
+ handwritten music
+ basic scripting to transpose etc.
+ search and replace with regex

### scripting simple solutions in python - format strings
+ iterating over arrays to populate format strings
+ format strings essentially had a predifined rhythmic pattern

### the abjad api 
+ the lowest level api in abjad is really fantastic
+ higher level abstractions and score organization feels foreign


## Designing a custom approach
+ staying close to a legible format the whole way through
