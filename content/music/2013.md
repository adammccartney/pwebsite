## Bird and Pine

+ partners: Matej Bunderla, Ivan Trenev, RTVSlovenia, Hristina Takovska
+ instruments: Saxophone, Accordion, Harmonium


Through the Balkans in Summer with a bunch of musicians from all over Europe and Asia.
This piece was written quickly for Hristina Takovska, who had the good sense to pester
me enough until I agreed to climb into a car and drive for 3000km in the height of the summer.

## Six Preludes

+ partners: Matej Bunderla, Ivan Trenev, esc
+ instruments: Saxophone, Accordion, Harmonium

Some combination of chance and geometric procedures. Premiered at a concert in esc im labor,
right after they moved to a new venue at BÃ¼rgergasse 5 in Graz. If you have not yet done so,
go and visit Reni Hofmueller there. She's a hero.

There's a brief sketch and a live recording of the pieces below. Using a diatonic mode
as the basis of a piece means that the material is pretty homogenous, so you can be a bit
more creative with the structure and process of the composition. It also sounds really good.

These preludes are at the root of another 6 compositions for the same instrumentation.
We recorded and released them as an LP titled **oek** in 3017. If you're interested
in hearing more of this music, get in touch and book us for a gig.
