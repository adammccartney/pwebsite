+ instruments: synthesizer, violin

Becoming Arctic is the name of a short film by Robert Platt. It's doing the
rounds at some film festivals in north america this year. The soundtrack was
composed using a formalized score pipeline written in python. The
instrumentation is violin and synthesizers, Boyana Maynalovska on the violin
and me trying to keep up on the keys. It was recorded at TIC studios in Vienna
