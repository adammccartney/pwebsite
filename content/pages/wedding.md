## Venue & Location

We're planning to meet for a reception and dinner, followed by some music at a
traditional Viennese "Heuriger" -- a type of local tavern where the proprietor
sells locally brewed hooch. [Schuebel-Auer](https://www.schuebel-auer.at/) is the
name of the venue. We plan to meet there from 5pm on Saturday 3rd June 2023. We
hope you can join us.


Heuriger Schuebel-Auer,

Kahlenberger Strasse 22,

1190 Wien

### Travel Info 

We're planning to organize a bus to and from the venue, but it's worth
mentioning that it is easily accessed using public transport. The venue is 
a short walk from the last stop on the "D" tram line. The stop is called "Beethovengang". 
Legend has it that the great composer frequented the area with a motley crew of hooligans 
who would stalk the banks of a local stream, terrifying passers by into giving up spare melodies.

#### Airport Travel 

The "S7" train is the recommended way to get from the airport to the city. It's
a lot cheaper than the "CAT" airport train and runs on exactly the same line,
albeit with a few more stops. Importantly it stops at "Rennweg" and
"Landstrasse/Wien Mitte", which are the stops closest to the two hotels
mentioned below.

## Hotels

We've been recommending the following two hotels to friends and family who are
visiting Vienna. They are both in the third district, close to our home and 
well connected with public transport to the rest of the city.

+ [Mercure Grand Hotel Biedermeier](https://mercure-grand-hotel-biedermeier-wien.meinhotel.top/en/)
+ [Hotel Savoyen](https://www.austria-trend.at/en/hotels/savoyen)

## RSVP

Please let us know if you are planning to come by the 22. April 2023.

## Wedding Registry

We don't have any specific gifts in mind and Sepideh has a mortal fear of
toasters, and we haven't really organized a wedding registry. Please do not feel
obligated to buy us a gift. All that we are expecting is _you_. If you would like
to give something, a contribution to our honeymoon fund would be much
appreciated. You can send us a gift using [paypal](https://paypal.me/amccartn?country.x=IE&locale.x=en_US), 
or by bank transfer using the following account details:
