title: About
---

I'm Adam, a human from Limerick, Ireland. I live in Vienna, Austria and work as
a software engineer doing mostly stuff related to cloud infrastructure and web
services for a university. I'm enthusiastic about free & open source software,
having been introduced by [mur.at](https://mur.at) and
[lilypond.org](https://lilypond.org). I also have a background in music
composition.
